In javascript the exection happens in the flowing way:

Javascript Execution Context:
    1. Global Execution Context -->  This is the most important part & it happens always. And
                                    this global exection context is stored in "this"
    2. Function Execution Context
    3. Eval Execution Context

The Execution of the javascript happens in following way :
    1. Memory Creation Phase
    2. Execution Phase
        This are the two methods and is used to ran any command


    ## MEMORY CREATION PHASE ##
        -- Here the value for the variable in memory is allocated undefined value.
        -- and In case of function entire function defination is copied. As it is not a variable.

    ## Execution PHASE ##
        -- In execution the variable the values is assigned
        -- And in case of the function comes in execution phase then a "New Variable Environment" + "Execution Thread"
